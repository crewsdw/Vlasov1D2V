# [Vlasov1D2V](https://github.com/crewsdw/Vlasov1D2V/)

This collection of Python codes solves the Vlasov-Poisson system in 1D+2V with up to 9th order spatial accuracy and 3rd order temporal accuracy using CUDA-accelerated libraries such as CuPy.

To use the program download the files, make a data folder, and adjust the run parameters in the "main.py" folder.
